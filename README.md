# Chess
Its a yet console based Chessgame in Java which works with textual input for choosing which piece moves to which square.

To Do:
-
-incorporate choosing a non-existent piece into the InvalidMoveException

-fix bug when using chars out of the a-h range where it just ignores this and moves the piece only along the different rows

-general check logic

-checkMate logic

-En passant

-Promotion

-Stalemate


-write isChecked() in King class, give the King the same "movement" as Queen and Knight and check if theres a piece in its vision
